Welcome to the DTCP Final Project.

	#Before you start

For now our program only works with the provided dataset so you'll need to download that in order to run it.


	#Program operation

Run all code blocks in order (as long as the import block is first and the tkinter box is last it should work fine) and when
you run the last box you'll get a pop-up window asking for inputs.  Simply input the voltage you want to see a pressure for,
select your confidence interval, and press enter or click the "Calculate" button to see your results.

If you want to add your own data to our dataset you can as well, just make sure that you enter numbers in each field because
it converts each input into a float and won't work if not every box has an entry.
